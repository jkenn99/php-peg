/**
 * By inheriting from Packrat instead of Parser, the parser will run in linear time (instead of exponential like
 * Parser), but will require a lot more memory, since every match-attempt at every position is memorised.
 *
 * Originally a single string was used as a storage for memoizing parser results.
 * This approach is now abandoned in favor of true PHP arrays, which now seem to be a better choice, since PHP 7.0
 * optimized internal workings of PHP arrays. It seems that using array as a storage actually has lower memory
 * footprint than the original "string" implementation.
 *
 * This refactoring also significantly simplified the packrat parser's code.
